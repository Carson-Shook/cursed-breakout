cursed-breakout
===============
  The beloved brick breaking game now running in your favorite terminal emulator!
  While browsing GitHub, I was unable to find any Breakout clones that were made in pure C, so I decided to rectify this.
  Cursed-breakout is built using the ncurses library, hence the name, and should run on any Posix system, though it is under active development, and nothing is guaranteed.
  Support for Windows will come after the program is more or less complete.

It's just a fun little project, and anyone who wants may use it for commercial or non-commercial projects, as long as the usage adheres to the MIT license. Have fun!

What currently works
====================
  Ball bounces, paddle moves, and pressing 'q' quits the game, but that's it for now.
  Currently working on properly making the ball velocity change according to where the paddle is struck.
